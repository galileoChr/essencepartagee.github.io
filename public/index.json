[{"content":"The Problem of Pretending How do we mathematically describe pretending as a structural phenomenon instead of a social or psychological sense? What is the geometry of maintaining two simultaneous states: an internal reality and an external projection?\nToroidal Flow: Internal ↔ External The torus provides an elegant framework. Consider:\nThe poloidal circulation (small loops) represents the internal state cycling through thoughts, emotions, authenticity The toroidal circulation (large loop through the center) represents external presentation cycling back through social feedback These aren\u0026rsquo;t separate systems. They\u0026rsquo;re a single continuous flow where:\n$$\\text{Internal State} \\xrightarrow{\\text{projection}} \\text{External Presentation} \\xrightarrow{\\text{feedback}} \\text{Internal State}$$\nWhy Pretending Works (Sometimes) Pretending succeeds when the system has sufficient degrees of freedom: enough \u0026ldquo;space\u0026rdquo; between the two circulations that they can temporarily differ without immediate collapse.\nConfidence example: You can project confidence (external) while feeling uncertain (internal) because confidence is primarily communicated through signals like posture, tone, eye contact. These have enough independence from your internal anxiety that the two states can coexist. Moreover, the external projection creates feedback that actually shifts the internal state. Here the torus can be described as generative.\nVision example: You cannot pretend to see if blind because vision is a direct perceptual constraint. There\u0026rsquo;s no degrees of freedom, no gap to exploit. The feedback is immediate and absolute.\nThe Parallax Fractal This relates to what I call the \u0026ldquo;parallax fractal\u0026rdquo;. The same structure viewed from different positions appears as:\nFrom inside: internal to external projection From outside: external to internal transformation From the side: a spiral ascending through time These could be described as different perspectives on a single toroidal flow.\nMathematical Framework If we define:\n$S_i(t)$ = internal state vector at time $t$ $S_e(t)$ = external presentation vector at time $t$ $T$ = transformation operator (toroidal flow) Then: $S_i(t+\\Delta t) = T[S_e(t), \\text{feedback}]$ and $S_e(t+\\Delta t) = T[S_i(t), \\text{intention}]$\nThe system is stable (pretending works) when $||S_i - S_e|| \u0026lt; \\epsilon$ for some tolerance $\\epsilon$ determined by the degrees of freedom in the domain.\nImplications This framework suggests pretending isn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;fake\u0026rdquo; in a simple sense. It\u0026rsquo;s like a real dynamical process that can shift the system\u0026rsquo;s state. The external performance isn\u0026rsquo;t separate from the internal reality; they\u0026rsquo;re coupled circulations in a toroidal geometry.\nStories with identical beginnings and endings are toroidal. You return to the \u0026ldquo;same\u0026rdquo; place but you\u0026rsquo;ve traveled through the transformation. The winding number has increased even if the position looks unchanged.\nThis is speculative theoretical work exploring mathematical structures in phenomenology. Comments and critiques welcome.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/essencepartagee.github.io/posts/toroidal-consciousness/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"the-problem-of-pretending\"\u003eThe Problem of Pretending\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do we mathematically describe pretending as a structural phenomenon instead of a social or psychological sense?

Most traders would look at this number and think: \u0026ldquo;I need to find the right filters. Maybe I should only trade during certain hours, or when volatility is high, or when the trend is strong.\u0026rdquo;\nBut a different question emerged: \u0026ldquo;What if 33% isn\u0026rsquo;t one thing, but a weighted average of many different things?\u0026rdquo;\nThis simple reframe changed everything.\nThe First Discovery: PCA Isn\u0026rsquo;t Just About Reducing Features When Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was first applied to the trading features, the expectation was that it would indicate which features to keep and which to discard.\nWhat actually emerged: PCA revealed that the market operates in multiple dimensions simultaneously.\nPC1 explained 18.7% of variance (momentum/trend) PC2 explained 13.1% of variance (volatility/structure) PC3 explained 12.2% of variance (mean reversion signals) PC4 explained 11.1% of variance (price positioning) Notice something? No single component dominated. In a truly simple system, PC1 might explain 60-70% of variance. But here, the variance was spread across multiple components of similar importance.\nThis revealed something profound: The market isn\u0026rsquo;t one system. It\u0026rsquo;s multiple systems running in parallel, all contributing to what appears as \u0026ldquo;price action.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat Was Measured: The 34 Features Rather than throwing random indicators at the wall, a multi-timeframe feature set was carefully constructed to capture different aspects of market structure:\nM15 (Entry Timeframe) ATR_M15 - Volatility at entry scale Spread_Pips - Transaction cost in real-time RSI_M15 - Momentum oscillator MACD_Hist_M15 - Momentum histogram BarsSinceLastCross - Signal frequency tracker H1 (Short-Term Context) H1_EMA_Slope - Immediate trend direction H1_Alignment - Price vs moving averages H1_ATR - Short-term volatility Dist_H1_High - Distance to recent resistance Dist_H1_Low - Distance to recent support H4 (Medium-Term Structure) H4_EMA_Slope - Medium-term trend direction H4_ADX - Trend strength indicator H4_Trend - Directional bias D1 (Macro Context) D1_EMA_Slope - Long-term trend direction D1_Trend - Daily directional bias D1_ATR - Long-term volatility Dist_D1_High - Distance to daily resistance Dist_D1_Low - Distance to daily support Risk \u0026amp; Money Management SL_ATR_Ratio - Stop loss sized to volatility TP_ATR_Ratio - Target sized to volatility RR_ATR_Adjusted - Risk-reward after volatility adjustment Price Structure Dist_Round_100 - Proximity to psychological levels (2800, 2900, etc.) Dist_Round_50 - Proximity to half-levels (2850, 2950, etc.) Recent Performance Last5_WinRate - Win rate of last 5 trades Last10_WinRate - Win rate of last 10 trades AvgRR_Last10 - Average risk-reward of recent trades Session \u0026amp; Timing Hour_GMT - Time of day DayOfWeek - Day of week IsLondon - London session indicator IsNY - New York session indicator IsOverlap - Session overlap indicator The goal: Capture market state across all dimensions—volatility, trend, momentum, timing, price structure, and recent regime quality.\nThe Regime Clustering Mistake (And What It Taught) The first attempt used K-means clustering to find \u0026ldquo;good regimes\u0026rdquo; versus \u0026ldquo;bad regimes.\u0026rdquo; The algorithm found 2 clusters:\nRegime 0: 31.4% win rate (39% of trades) Regime 1: 34.0% win rate (61% of trades) Initially, this appeared to be a failure. Both regimes performed poorly. The silhouette score (0.372) indicated \u0026ldquo;weak clustering.\u0026rdquo;\nBut then the realization hit: This wasn\u0026rsquo;t a failure. This was the data telling the truth.\nThe market wasn\u0026rsquo;t hiding a \u0026ldquo;golden regime\u0026rdquo; waiting to be discovered. The poor clustering meant wins and losses were randomly distributed across the feature space. There was no secret pocket where the strategy worked brilliantly.\nThe insight: Learning to listen when data says \u0026ldquo;there\u0026rsquo;s no pattern here\u0026rdquo; rather than forcing a pattern to exist.\nThe Real Breakthrough: Multi-Timeframe System Theory This is where things got interesting.\nThe search shifted from looking for \u0026ldquo;good versus bad\u0026rdquo; to mapping the complete ecosystem. Features were separated by timeframe:\nM15 features → M15 System Component H1 features → H1 System Component H4 features → H4 System Component D1 features → D1 System Component Then these four systems were visualized in how they interact in 3D and 4D space.\nThe complete web of M15 × H1 × H4 interactions. Red = losses, Green = wins. Notice how they\u0026rsquo;re completely mixed—no clear \u0026lsquo;winning zone\u0026rsquo; exists.\nWhat the visualization revealed was beautiful and brutal at the same time.\nBeautiful: The complete web structure became visible. The intricate dance of how micro-movements (M15) interact with short-term flows (H1), medium-term trends (H4), and macro structure (D1) emerged. The market revealed itself not as chaos, but as a structured multi-scale system.\nBrutal: Even in the best configurations, performance was mediocre.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Three Connected Circles\u0026rdquo; Concept Here\u0026rsquo;s where real insight emerged.\nAnalysis of timeframe alignment—how often M15, H1, and H4 agreed on direction—revealed a clear pattern:\n0 timeframes aligned: 28.9% win rate (total disagreement = noise) 1 timeframe aligned: 34.2% win rate (weak signal) 2 timeframes aligned: 31.2% win rate (moderate signal) 3 timeframes aligned: 36.0% win rate (strong signal) Progressive improvement as more timeframes align. But even perfect alignment only achieves 36% win rate—barely profitable.\nThis progression revealed something critical: The market operates through consensus across timeframes.\nWhen only M15 says \u0026ldquo;go long\u0026rdquo; but H1, H4, and D1 disagree, the trade fights the larger structure. When all timeframes align, the trade moves with the full weight of market structure.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the sophisticated part: The 33% overall win rate isn\u0026rsquo;t random. It\u0026rsquo;s the weighted average of all these states:\n10% of trades: M15-|H1-|H4- (all bearish) → 38.9% win rate → contributes 3.9pp 14% of trades: M15+|H1+|H4- (mixed signals) → 37.6% win rate → contributes 5.3pp 18% of trades: M15+|H1+|H4+ (all bullish) → 36.5% win rate → contributes 6.6pp 22% of trades: M15-|H1-|H4+ (contrarian) → 31.2% win rate → contributes 6.9pp ... Sum = 33% The insight: The 33% isn\u0026rsquo;t a failure. It\u0026rsquo;s a COMPOSITION. Like white light splitting into a spectrum, aggregate performance decomposed into its constituent parts.\nWhat This Revealed About Market Structure 1. Markets Are Multi-Scale Systems What happens on M15 isn\u0026rsquo;t independent of what happens on H4. They\u0026rsquo;re coupled. A strong H4 trend creates a bias that influences M15 behavior. When H4 says \u0026ldquo;uptrend\u0026rdquo; but M15 generates a \u0026ldquo;sell signal,\u0026rdquo; the trade doesn\u0026rsquo;t just fight one timeframe—it fights the cascade of larger timeframes.\nThe insight: This is why professional traders emphasize \u0026ldquo;timeframe confluence.\u0026rdquo; They\u0026rsquo;re recognizing that market structure exists across scales, and trading with multi-timeframe agreement means trading with the weight of that structure.\n2. Homogeneous Mediocrity Versus Heterogeneous Performance This is subtle but crucial.\nAnalysis found NO sub-system with \u0026gt;40% win rate. The best was 38.9%. Most were below 35%.\nThis indicates: The moving average crossover strategy doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a strong edge in ANY market condition. It\u0026rsquo;s not about \u0026ldquo;trading it in the wrong conditions.\u0026rdquo; The strategy itself lacks robustness.\nThe value: This saved months or years of optimization hell. Time could have been spent forever tweaking parameters, trying different filters, adjusting stop losses. But the fundamental architecture is flawed. No amount of optimization fixes a strategy that performs uniformly poorly across all sub-systems.\n3. Transitions Don\u0026rsquo;t Create Edge (In This Case) Testing whether system state transitions—the moments when market structure shifts—create opportunities or dangers showed:\nDuring transitions: ~33% win rate During stable states: ~33% win rate No significant difference.\nWhat this means: The market doesn\u0026rsquo;t telegraph its intentions through abrupt regime changes. There are no clear boundaries where behavior shifts dramatically.\nThe insight: Some markets DO have this property. During regime transitions, volatility spikes and strategy performance degrades. But gold on M15 with MA crossover? Smooth transitions. This indicates the timeframes blend continuously rather than shifting discretely.\nThe Statistical Significance Lesson Early on, regimes with 45%, 50%, even 55% win rates appeared. Excitement followed.\nThen sample sizes were checked: 15 setups, 20 setups, 25 setups.\nThe lesson: At small sample sizes, random variance dominates signal. A regime might show 50% win rate with 20 setups purely by chance.\nSo proper statistical testing was implemented:\n# Proportion z-test # Only accept if: # 1. p \u0026lt; 0.05 (statistically significant) # 2. improvement \u0026gt; 3pp (practically significant) # 3. n \u0026gt; 30 (sufficient sample size) When these filters were applied, the \u0026ldquo;amazing\u0026rdquo; regimes vanished. They were statistical noise.\nThe insight: This taught intellectual humility. Data will show patterns that don\u0026rsquo;t exist if allowed to. Rigorous testing protects against pattern-seeking cognitive biases.\nWhat This Framework Provides 1. A Map of Market Structure The market can now be seen not as a single entity but as an ecosystem:\n[M15 Micro-movements] ↓ [H1 Short-term flows] ↓ [H4 Medium-term trends] ↓ [D1 Macro structure] Each level influences the next. When they align (confluence), cleaner moves emerge. When they disagree (divergence), choppy, difficult conditions appear.\n2. A Framework for Any Strategy This approach isn\u0026rsquo;t specific to moving averages. It can be applied to ANY trading system:\nBreakout strategies: How do breakouts perform across different timeframe configurations? Mean reversion: Which timeframe overlaps favor reversal? News trading: How does multi-timeframe structure affect news reaction? The value: A general framework for understanding strategy performance across market states.\n3. A Decision-Making Tool Before: binary thinking—\u0026ldquo;Should I take this trade?\u0026rdquo;\nNow: contextual thinking:\n\u0026#34;A signal appears. Checking: - M15 says: Long - H1 says: Neutral - H4 says: Short Timeframe disagreement = 0 aligned Expected win rate: ~29% Decision: Pass. Wait for alignment.\u0026#34; 4. Protection Against Overfitting By mapping ALL sub-systems, it becomes visible whether edge is:\nConcentrated (one regime works, others fail → fragile, likely overfit) Distributed (multiple regimes work similarly → robust) Absent (all regimes mediocre → strategy issue) In this case: Absent. This prevented over-optimizing a fundamentally weak strategy.\nThe Brutal Honesty Gained Here\u0026rsquo;s what wasn\u0026rsquo;t found:\nA \u0026ldquo;golden regime\u0026rdquo; with 60% win rate hiding in the data A perfect parameter combination that makes everything work A secret the market was hiding waiting to be unlocked Here\u0026rsquo;s what WAS found:\nComplete transparency into how the strategy performs across ALL market states Clear evidence that the strategy lacks robust edge Understanding of WHY it lacks edge (performs poorly everywhere, not just some places) A framework to test OTHER strategies more intelligently The insight: The difference between \u0026ldquo;finding edge\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;understanding structure.\u0026rdquo;\nSometimes the most valuable discovery is learning what DOESN\u0026rsquo;T work, and why, so time isn\u0026rsquo;t wasted on it.\nWhat Could Be Done Differently Next Time Armed with this framework, here\u0026rsquo;s an improved approach:\nPhase 1: Rapid Viability Test 1. Collect data (already done) 2. Apply multi-timeframe system analysis 3. Check: Do ANY sub-systems show \u0026gt;40% win rate? If NO → Strategy is fundamentally weak, move on If YES → Proceed to optimization Time saved: Weeks or months of futile optimization.\nPhase 2: Sub-System Optimization For systems with \u0026gt;40% win rate: 1. Identify which timeframe configurations work 2. Build filters to trade ONLY those configurations 3. Test robustness across time periods 4. Implement with conservative position sizing Phase 3: Regime-Aware Position Sizing Don\u0026#39;t just trade or not trade. Scale position size by expected edge: 3 timeframes aligned (36% WR) → 1.0% risk 2 timeframes aligned (31% WR) → 0.5% risk 1 timeframe aligned (34% WR) → 0.7% risk 0 timeframes aligned (29% WR) → Skip The Deepest Insight: Markets As Complex Adaptive Systems Through this process, thinking about markets shifted.\nOld thinking: \u0026ldquo;The market is going up or down. I need to predict which.\u0026rdquo;\nNew thinking: \u0026ldquo;The market is a multi-scale system where different timeframes process information at different speeds. Price is the output of their interaction. The job isn\u0026rsquo;t to predict price, but to identify configurations where these timeframes agree, creating temporary statistical edges.\u0026rdquo;\nThis is the shift from prediction to pattern recognition.\nThe goal isn\u0026rsquo;t knowing what price will do. It\u0026rsquo;s knowing what configuration exists, and how that configuration historically behaves.\nWhat This Means for Trading Psychology One final insight: This framework changes how drawdowns are experienced.\nBefore:\n7 losses in a row: \u0026#34;Oh no, the strategy stopped working! The market changed! I need to fix something!\u0026#34; After:\n7 losses in a row: \u0026#34;Checking system state... Currently in \u0026#39;M15+|H1-|H4+\u0026#39; configuration. Historical win rate: 31% 7 losses from a 31% win rate system = normal variance Expected losing streak at this win rate: up to 12 trades Well within normal bounds. Continue trading the system.\u0026#34; The insight: Psychological stability through structural understanding.\nThe Path Forward: Making Money (Yes, That\u0026rsquo;s Still The Goal) Let\u0026rsquo;s be honest—understanding market structure is fascinating, but trading is about making money.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what this research means for profitability:\nWhat Won\u0026rsquo;t Work: Keep optimizing MA crossover hoping for 50% win rate Add more filters to a fundamentally weak strategy Trade all signals and hope for the best What Will Work: Apply this framework to OTHER strategies - Test breakouts, mean reversion, volatility expansion systems Use 3-timeframe alignment as a filter - Only trade when M15, H1, H4 agree (36% win rate barely profitable, but it\u0026rsquo;s a start) Build a strategy portfolio - Different strategies for different timeframe configurations Scale position size by edge - Risk 2% on high-confidence setups, 0.5% on marginal ones The Real Opportunity: This framework revealed that MA crossover is weak everywhere. But that\u0026rsquo;s ONE strategy on ONE timeframe on ONE instrument.\nWhat if testing includes:\nBreakouts on gold M15 during London open? Mean reversion on gold H1 during low volatility? Trend following on gold H4 with D1 confirmation? News-based volatility expansion strategies? Each gets the full PCA + multi-timeframe analysis treatment. Map ALL sub-systems. Find what works, where it works, and HOW OFTEN it works.\nThe edge isn\u0026rsquo;t in one perfect strategy. It\u0026rsquo;s in understanding the complete structure of multiple strategies across multiple market states.\nProfessional quant funds don\u0026rsquo;t run one strategy. They run portfolios of 50-100 strategies, each designed for specific market configurations. When regime X appears, strategy A activates. When regime Y appears, strategy B activates.\nBuilding that same capability, one analysis at a time.\nWant to Replicate This Research? This research believes in open knowledge and collaborative learning. Here\u0026rsquo;s what can be shared:\nThe Data The dataset includes 1,564 MA crossover setups on XAUUSD (gold) M15 timeframe from March 2021 to December 2024. Each setup includes:\nEntry price, stop loss, take profit All 34 features listed above Outcome (win/loss) Timestamp Interested in the raw data? Considering releasing the CSV files for community analysis. If there\u0026rsquo;s enough interest, they\u0026rsquo;ll be made available for download. Let us know in the comments.\nThe Analysis Code The entire analysis pipeline was built in Jupyter notebooks for reproducibility:\nPCA_Regime_Clustering.ipynb - Initial regime discovery using K-means Multi_Timeframe_System_Web.ipynb - Complete multi-scale system analysis honest_regime_analysis.py - Statistical significance testing framework Each notebook includes:\nStep-by-step explanations Visualization code Statistical testing procedures Interpretations of results Want the analysis code? If there\u0026rsquo;s sufficient interest from the trading community, the full Jupyter notebooks will be released on GitHub. This would allow:\nReplicating this analysis on your own strategies Testing different instruments and timeframes Extending the framework with your own ideas Contributing improvements back to the community Drop a comment if this would be useful.\nWhy Share This? The trading community benefits from open research. Too much \u0026ldquo;proprietary knowledge\u0026rdquo; is just repackaged common sense sold at premium prices.\nReal edge comes from:\nBetter execution Superior risk management Psychological discipline Portfolio construction Position sizing Not from secret indicators or magic parameters.\nIf sharing this framework helps 100 traders avoid wasting months on weak strategies, that\u0026rsquo;s more valuable than hoarding it.\nPlus, seeing what others discover using these tools would be valuable. Collaborative research compounds faster than solo research.\nConclusion: The Real Treasure The goal was to improve a 33% win rate strategy.\nThe discovery: it couldn\u0026rsquo;t be done—at least not with the current approach.\nBut something more valuable emerged: a complete framework for understanding how any strategy performs across the full spectrum of market states.\nKey learnings:\nHow to decompose aggregate performance into sub-systems How to visualize multi-dimensional market structure How to test rigorously against random chance How to think about markets as multi-scale systems How to avoid overfitting by mapping complete structure When to abandon a strategy versus when to optimize it The ultimate value: The ability to look at ANY trading system and ask:\n\u0026ldquo;Show me the sub-systems. Show me where edge concentrates. Show me whether it\u0026rsquo;s robust or fragile. Show me whether optimization would help or hurt.\u0026rdquo;\nThis is the shift from trial-and-error trader to quantitative researcher.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s worth far more than any single strategy.\nBecause here\u0026rsquo;s the truth: One good strategy makes money for a while. A framework for evaluating strategies makes money forever.\nThe Journey Continues Next steps in this research:\nTest this framework on breakout strategies - Gold respects ranges; maybe breakouts work where MA crossover doesn\u0026rsquo;t Analyze session-based patterns - London open volatility might create exploitable edges Build strategy portfolio - Different approaches for different market configurations Extend to other instruments - Does this framework reveal similar structure in FX, crypto, indices? Everything will be documented. The wins, the losses, the surprises, the failures.\nBecause the real edge isn\u0026rsquo;t in hiding what\u0026rsquo;s learned—it\u0026rsquo;s in learning faster than everyone else.\nQuestions for the community:\nWould the raw data be useful for your own research? Should the Jupyter notebooks be released publicly? What other strategies should be analyzed with this framework? What markets/timeframes are you most interested in seeing analyzed? Let us know in the comments. If there\u0026rsquo;s enough interest, everything will be packaged up and released.\nThe journey continues. Next: testing this framework on different strategies, different timeframes, different markets. Armed with structural understanding, no longer shooting in the dark. Mapping the terrain, one system at a time.\nAnd yes, still here to make money. But now with a map.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/essencepartagee.github.io/posts/market-microstructure-journey/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"where-it-started\"\u003eWhere It Started\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe research began with a simple question that traders ask every day: \u0026ldquo;Why does this moving average crossover strategy only win 33% of the time?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the surface, this seems like a straightforward problem.
