## The Problem of Pretending

How do we mathematically describe pretending as a structural phenomenon instead of a social or psychological sense? What is the *geometry* of maintaining two simultaneous states: an internal reality and an external projection?

## Toroidal Flow: Internal ↔ External

The torus provides an elegant framework. Consider:

- The **poloidal circulation** (small loops) represents the internal state cycling through thoughts, emotions, authenticity
- The **toroidal circulation** (large loop through the center) represents external presentation cycling back through social feedback

These aren't separate systems. They're a single continuous flow where:

$$\text{Internal State} \xrightarrow{\text{projection}} \text{External Presentation} \xrightarrow{\text{feedback}} \text{Internal State}$$

## Why Pretending Works (Sometimes)

Pretending succeeds when the system has **sufficient degrees of freedom**: enough "space" between the two circulations that they can temporarily differ without immediate collapse.

**Confidence example**: You can project confidence (external) while feeling uncertain (internal) because confidence is primarily communicated through *signals* like posture, tone, eye contact. These have enough independence from your internal anxiety that the two states can coexist. Moreover, the external projection creates feedback that actually shifts the internal state. Here the torus can be described as *generative*.

**Vision example**: You cannot pretend to see if blind because vision is a *direct perceptual constraint*. There's no degrees of freedom, no gap to exploit. The feedback is immediate and absolute.

## The Parallax Fractal

This relates to what I call the "parallax fractal". The same structure viewed from different positions appears as:
- From inside: internal to external projection
- From outside: external to internal transformation
- From the side: a spiral ascending through time

These could be described as different *perspectives* on a single toroidal flow.

## Mathematical Framework

If we define:
- $S_i(t)$ = internal state vector at time $t$
- $S_e(t)$ = external presentation vector at time $t$
- $T$ = transformation operator (toroidal flow)

Then: $S_i(t+\Delta t) = T[S_e(t), \text{feedback}]$ and $S_e(t+\Delta t) = T[S_i(t), \text{intention}]$

The system is stable (pretending works) when $||S_i - S_e|| < \epsilon$ for some tolerance $\epsilon$ determined by the degrees of freedom in the domain.

## Implications

This framework suggests pretending isn't "fake" in a simple sense. It's like a real dynamical process that can shift the system's state. The external performance isn't separate from the internal reality; they're coupled circulations in a toroidal geometry.

Stories with identical beginnings and endings are toroidal. You return to the "same" place but you've traveled through the transformation. The winding number has increased even if the position looks unchanged.
