## Welcome

This blog is a space for exploring deep questions through mathematical frameworks and quantitative analysis. Topics range from trading system architecture to consciousness models, from market microstructure to quantum observation limits.

## What You'll Find Here

**Trading Research**
- Quantitative analysis of trading strategies
- Market microstructure studies
- Multi-timeframe system analysis
- Regime detection and classification

**Theoretical Frameworks**
- Mathematical models of consciousness
- Topology and geometry in phenomenology
- Information theory and observation limits
- Physics at the boundaries of measurement

## Contributing to the Discussion

## Research Philosophy

This work operates under several principles:

**Open Research**: Most findings, code, and data are shared publicly. Knowledge compounds faster when it's accessible.

**Rigorous Testing**: Claims are backed by data, statistical tests, and reproducible analysis. No cherry-picking, no curve-fitting without disclosure.

**Intellectual Honesty**: Failures are documented alongside successes. Negative results teach as much as positive ones.

**Cross-Domain Thinking**: The best insights often come from applying frameworks from one domain to problems in another.

## Current Focus

Active research areas:
- Multi-scale system analysis in financial markets
- Topological models of state transitions
- Information limits in observation and measurement
- Dimensionality reduction in high-frequency data

## About Reproducibility

Where possible, posts include:
- Links to datasets
- Analysis code (Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts)
- Statistical test results
- Parameter choices and their justification

The goal is for you to be able to verify, extend, or refute the findings.
